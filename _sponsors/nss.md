NSS prepares adults with aptitude, motivation, and drive for careers in software development, UI/UX design, and data science.

The school is committed to growing diversity in these fields by creating opportunities for underrepresented groups in tech.

Founded in 2012, NSS is a flourishing community of 700+ alumni, 100+ active students, and a team of dedicated instructors helping each other grow and learn their craft. Nashville employers and mentors who give back to the community and support future tech talent are vital to their success.
