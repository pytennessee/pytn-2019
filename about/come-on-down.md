# Come On Down, Y'all
## Five Reasons To Attend PyTennessee

Attending conferences is a habit every great programmer cultivates. Here are some reasons why PyTennessee is worthy of making *your* personal lineup.

### 1. Update Your Knowledge Portfolio

Interested in gaining practical knowledge that you can immediately put to use? PyTennessee has you covered. Our talks span a wide variety of subjects, including cybersecurity, web applications, software development lifecycles, and design patterns.

### 2. Get Inspired

We fly in speakers from all over the world to help you push your boundaries. At PyTennessee, you will hear industry leaders speak about how they organize both their code and careers. We guarantee you will walk away with some concrete ideas for your own.


### 3. Music City, USA

Nashville is one of America's fastest-growing cities and for good reason. Live music, museums, beautiful parks, and breweries are scattered all across the city. We encourage you to check them out (Not during conference hours, of course!). As our conference chair likes to say, "Come for the code, stay for the hot chicken." üêì

### 4. The People

Whether you are hiring or looking to get hired, you will never find a denser collection of the South's best programmers than you will at PyTennessee. Even if aren't frequenting human resources these days, it's a great opportunity to gain new friends, peers, mentors, and mentees.

### 5. Maximum Value

Now in its 6th year, PyTennessee has gained a reputation as one of the best regional Python conferences in America. We keep our ticket prices low and offer financial aid, so that everyone who wants to can seize this opportunity to accelerate their Python programming skills and career.

We look forward to [seeing you there](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pytennessee-2019-tickets-50024781468)!
