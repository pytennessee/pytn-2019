## Talk Description

Time Series data is ubiquitous; whether you're doing DevOps, analyzing business metrics, or measuring the output of thousands of IoT sensors, you're going to need the right tools for the job. Time Series databases are designed specifically for this kind of data, so how can we integrate one with our Python stack? Learn how to use Python to collect data from both software applications and the physical world and store it in InfluxDB, as well as how to query the data and perform basic time series analysis.
