about: I am a Web Developer, Professor, Writer, Hogwarts Student, and Doctor Who Companion... Okay, so maybe I am not a student at Hogwarts… I am sure I'd be sorted into Ravenclaw! And, maybe I am not a Doctor Who companion… But wouldn’t time traveling in the TARDIS be amazing? My career started, not in magic, but in education. I taught middle school English before I went back to school full-time to earn a Ph.D. in Language and Literacy from Georgia State University, and worked as a Professor of Literacy at Kennesaw State University (GA). After years of teaching, I decided to leverage my background in language and literacy for a new career as a Front End Developer with an affinity for clean, classic web design with original and well-commented code. However, I have never truly left education, and I have applied what I know about education from years of study and practice to how people learn to code. I write a blog with the focus&#58; A Professor's Perspective on Learning to Code. I help new coders understand their unique learning process and their individual learning styles. I help coding instructors learn to differentiate their instruction to meet the needs of diverse learners. Further, I help coders understand WHY learning to code is complex, and how to chose the best resources to meet their needs. 
abstract: Are you teaching or learning Python? In order to make the most of the experience, we must move the learning through a hierarchy of objectives (Bloom’s Taxonomy). See how the Harry Potter series illustrates this learning hierarchy in the magical world, then apply that to teaching & learning Python.

## Talk Description

Have you thought about teaching Python? Are you trying to learn Python? To be successful, it is critical that the learning experiences move you through a hierarchy of learning objectives (known in education as Bloom’s Taxonomy). This ensures that you can progress from simply recalling coding concepts to being able to develop your own original code. The hierarchy has six levels: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create. But what does Harry Potter have to do with the learning objectives and coding? Simple. Throughout the seven books & eight movies in the Harry Potter series, there are numerous examples demonstrating each of the learning objectives in the hierarchy. Remember, Harry is experiencing a steep learning curve. Harry must learn potions, charms, and transfiguration, all with tools he has never used before. Doesn’t that sound familiar? Instead of magic, you are learning the language of Python as well as learning to think like a programmer. Instead of a cauldron and wand, you are using a text editor and a debugger, maybe Python Tutor. In this presentation, I address the six levels in the hierarchy, describe the types of learning outcomes in each level using action verbs, provide a clear example from the Harry Potter series with video clips, and then relate it back to teaching and learning Python.
