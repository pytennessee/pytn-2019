about: Casey Faist is the Queen Snake of Heroku, where she owns the Python experience. She previously helped kickstart the developer careers of millions by building dockerized sandbox environments for the browser and parsing AST trees. She has also spent years using Python to extract, process and curate Medium Data that was mistaken at some point for Big Data. She likes hugs, sharks, and thinks combining those things would be awesome when done very carefully.
abstract: You know you're curious. How are data classes different from other Python classes? Are they more like a Haskell monad or a PHP closure? Why can't I just use a dictionary? Come on a cross-language comparative journey to discover just what are, and how best to use, Python 3.7's classiest new feature.

## Talk Description

What makes this better than using a normal object or dictionary? Are they actually more memory efficient? Why shouldn't I just write my own dunder methods for this? Come explore the ins, outs, and whys of Data Classes by looking at them from lenses both inside and outside of Python! Comparing language features might be pitting apples against oranges, but sometimes, it's just as important to know what a feature is not to use it effectively. So let's throw some comparative color onto the pep - we may just find the perfect spot in your developer toolbox for the data class to live. Join me for this can't miss deep dive into data classiness.
