## Talk Description

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are all the rage in the security world. They’re becoming more and more ubiquitous in web authentication libraries, and are commonly used to store a user’s identity information.

In this talk Randall Degges, Lead Developer Advocate at Okta, will take you on an extensive tour of the web authentication landscape. You’ll learn how JWTs and Sessions work, and why JWTs are the worst possible solution for solving web authentication problems.

You’ll also learn the real reason behind JWTs rise to fame, and better ways to secure your websites that don’t involve misplaced hype.

Specifically, Randall will explain:

* How JWTs work
* How sessions work
* Why people like JWTs more than sessions
* Why all of the good things you heard about JWTs are incorrect
* How to properly secure websites using sessions
* Why JWTs are never the right solution
* How JWTs got so popular in the first place
* When *should* you use JWTs?
