## Talk Description

Have you heard of Serverless, and are excited about the various promises? Dreaming of a world where you don’t need to manage servers, you get horizontal scaling out of the box, you only pay for the cycles you actually use, and ultimately you only concern yourself with providing direct business value?  All of this sounds great, but how do you actually get started?  What makes your problem a good fit for a Serverless solution?

In this talk we’ll explore the following topics:

- What is Serverless?
- What are some of the benefits of using Serverless?
- How can you get started with implementing your own python app on a Serverless platform?
- What other services and tooling are available?

Attendees should walk away with a solid foundation as well as some initial steps they can take to get started with their own Serverless explorations.
