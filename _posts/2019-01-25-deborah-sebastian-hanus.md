Deborah Hanus and Sebastian Hanus are PyTN conference co-speakers presenting a talk on [To comment or not to comment? Conflicting attitudes towards commenting and beginner pain.](https://www.pytennessee.org/talks/to-comment-or-not-to-comment "To comment or not to comment? Conflicting attitudes towards commenting and beginner pain.") at PyTN 2019. We are thrilled to have them as a speakers, and share their enthusiasm for Python and PyTN 2019 below!

#### What have you been working on lately that you're excited about? (It can totally be non-tech related!)

Deborah: This year, I started Sparrow, a software-based service that makes it simple for companies to provide their employees with extended leave like family leave. We've been learning a lot and making a lot of great progress! I also enjoy blogging and adding matcha to everything I eat.

Sebastian: I recently gave a short talk on Scapy at NeCERT’s Cyber Security Forum; that was fun. I’ve also been learning about cool decentralized networks like Freenet and Zeronet.


#### What's a way that you think the Python community has grown that you didn't expect? Where do you think the Python community/ecosystem could develop further?

Deborah: When I started using Python in college, I believe that the community could do basically anything, and for the most part, my belief has been correct. The Python community has done a lovely job of getting a large group of programmers who are striving for (or at least thinking about) inclusion, which I think is amazing. 

Sebastian: I also love how Python is not only syntactically friendly to new programmers but how supportive the community is too. When you combine a readable, practical base language with a wide enough array of libraries to make other languages envious, you really bring everyone together.


#### What are some of the learning resources you'd suggest to newcomers to the Python language?

Deborah: Some of my favorites are: 
Learn Python the Hard Way 
Python Morsels with Trey Hunner 

Sebastian: A Python interpreter and a hundred monkeys with typewriters.


#### How hot do you like your hot chicken, and for how many meals are you going to eat it while you're here?

Deborah: I actually don't like chicken, so probably not very many. But we can still be friends! :)

Sebastian: I like chicken, and I like a little spiciness, but I still have a mortal digestive tract. I look forward to trying it!


#### Do you have any advice for getting the most out of a technology conference?

Deborah: Some of the advice that has worked best for me is: 
1. Check out the hallway track.  
The talks are great, but sometimes it is easier to meet people 
2. It's OK to take recharge breaks. 
3. Give a talk. 
Everyone has something to talk about, and learning how to craft your experiences into a story that people learn something from is super-rewarding. 

Sebastian: If you are giving a talk, it’s nice to be prepared enough ahead of time that you don’t spend the whole conference before your talk stressing and preparing for it.


#### Have you ever been to Nashville? If so, is there anything you recommend first timers do while they're here? If not, is there anything you're excited to see or do while you're here?

Deborah: I've been to Nashville once before when I spoke at PyTN 2017. I was not in town long enough to see much of the city, but I met some wonderful people who I'm still in touch with. I'm looking forward to meeting more wonderful people at PyTN 2019!

Sebastian: I’ve never been to Nashville, but I really look forward to visiting and meeting new people!
