#### What have you been working on lately that you’re excited about? (It can totally be non-tech related!)

I’ve been experimenting with adding screenshots to my version control as a way of documenting the visual changes in the front end of my projects, both as a reference for me (I’m very visual!) and for others who may want to contribute. I’ll be talking about my Git-ventures at PyTennessee!

#### What are some of the learning resources you’d suggest to newcomers to the Python language?

One reason I started learning Python (my “first love” language & still my go-to!) when I decided to learn to program was that I heard more experienced folks talk about how welcoming the community is. As a self-taught developer, I was bracing myself for a long journey, and I knew all those informal connections and resource recommendations would be important!

For those learning Python as a first programming language, I recommend a path similar to mine: Codecademy’s “Learn Python” for a line-by-line introduction, the Boston Python Workshop exercises build skills for tutorial-to-on-your-own jump (“big questions” & links provided, decisions your own!), and some combination of Python the Hard Way or the Python Docs for a “Python Tour” (both are great in their own way - consider your learning style)! For those new to Python but experienced in other languages, I recommend starting with Python.org’s blog post on the subject.

Congratulations on selecting a wonderful next/first language and welcome!

#### Do you have any advice for getting the most out of a technology conference?

I actually have a lot of advice on this! Last year, I did my first “whirlwind” of attended conferences and I thought a lot about what had helped me hold it together that month. I wrote a post about that experience on my blog.

This year, I’m lucky enough to be speaking at three conferences in February (1 US, 2 international!) and attending another, so I’m sure I’ll be posting an updated version of the post!

My #1 challenge is opening conversations with so many people and remembering that I’m interesting and have something to say (it’s hard to stay positive when you’re tired!). My two pieces of advice for feeling on top of these conversations is to (a) keep having them (most people are happy you are starting a conversation - they may be feeling the same way you are!) and (b) be explicit about how you are feeling, what you’d like to talk about, etc. as the conversation picks up so you can both be comfortable and have more energy for even more chats!

#### How hot do you like your hot chicken, and for how many meals are you going to eat it while you’re here?

All chicken should be served hot - we’re talking about temperature, right? I’m from the midwest & NYC so I’m used to the blandest chicken you can imagine (back home we boil it & eat as-is), but I do like it piping hot! Sounds like I’m in for an adventure!

#### Have you ever been to Nashville? If so, is there anything you recommend first timers do while they’re here? If not, is there anything you’re excited to see or do while you’re here?

I’m excited to be visiting Nashville for the first time! I grew up listening to country music (and I've heard that Nashville is the career “hot spot” for that), so I assume I’ll be able to remember the words and bop along. Do you all have karaoke?
